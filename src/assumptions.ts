/**
 * Conditional soundness: assumptions and judgments.
 *
 * The core invariant evolved in this layer: every reachable state is
 * equivalent to the original equation GIVEN its assumption set. Moves that
 * are only valid under a condition (dividing by b needs b ≠ 0) or that can
 * gain solutions (multiplying both sides) are not forbidden — the condition
 * becomes a first-class, visible object that travels with the equation.
 *
 * THE POLARITY DISTINCTION (the heart of this design):
 *  - A Restriction is emitted by moves that may LOSE solutions. It narrows
 *    the domain: "this state is equivalent to the original wherever
 *    expr ≠ value holds."
 *  - An Extension is emitted by moves that may GAIN solutions. It carries an
 *    OBLIGATION: candidate solutions must be checked against the original
 *    equation (which the Extension carries) before the derivation is settled.
 *  - A Pinned is a user-introduced what-if ("assume x = 2"), never emitted by
 *    rewrite rules.
